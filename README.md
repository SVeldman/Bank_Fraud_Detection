# Explainable AI for Bank Account Fraud Detection

This project explored the dual mandate of developing machine learning models to detect bank account fraud from a large, imbalanced dataset and utilizing explainable AI techniques to provide insight around and transparency into the models' decisions. This repository contains our full presentation slide deck, as well as our literature review and code notebooks.
